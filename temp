Initial Challenges with Scrum Clarity
•• Our automation team was facing difficulties in keeping up with development progress.
•• Discussions were often missed or misunderstood, causing confusion.
•• There was a gap in collaboration between teams, leading to delays in task alignment.
Introducing Persona Recording Sharing
•• To address these challenges, we implemented a persona recording sharing process.
•• This allowed us to revisit recorded discussions and gain better insights.
•• Recordings were shared across teams, enhancing collaboration and communication.

How Recording Sharing Improved Scrum Clarity
•• Better Sprint Planning: Enabled better task prioritization through access to recorded discussions.
•• Real-Time Updates: Automation team remained up-to-date with development tasks.
•• Early Awareness of Changes: Preemptive knowledge of feature implementations.
•• Clarified Discussion Outcomes: Revisited recordings to understand decisions and reduce misunderstandings.
•• Improved Transparency: Acted as a bridge for better communication, reducing rework.
Results: Improved Collaboration

Recording sharing bridged the gap between the automation and development teams.
• Enhanced clarity led to smoother rollouts and timely script preparation.
• Significant reduction in rework and misunderstandings.
• Overall, the process fostered a more transparent and collaborative environment.
